# 🌤️ Breezy — iOS Weather App
A beautifully crafted iOS weather experience inspired by Apple’s native Weather app.


## 🚀 Overview
Breezy is a modern, SwiftUI-based weather application designed to deliver fast, elegant, and accurate weather updates.
This app is built with clean architecture, async/await networking, modular services, and secure API key handling using Keychain.

Breezy automatically detects the user’s current city using Core Location and provides:
* Real-time weather
* Hourly forecast
* 7-day forecast
* Beautiful gradients + SF Symbols
* Multi-city support with swipe-to-switch
* Smooth animations inspired by iOS Weather


## ✨ Features
### 🌍 Location-Based Weather
* Automatic city detection
* Smooth permission screen with modern UI
* Reverse-geocoding for exact city names

## 🌦️ Forecast
* Current temperature + condition
* Hourly forecast
* Weekly forecast with temperature range bars
* Weather icons using SF Symbols
* Dynamic backgrounds based on weather & time


## 🏙️ Multiple Cities
* User can add multiple cities
* Swipe through cities using TabView paging
* 🔒 Secure API Key Storage
* API key stored using Keychain
* Securely loaded at app startup
* No hardcoded secrets


## 🧩 Clean Architecture
* SwiftUI for UI
* ObservableObject / StateObject for MVVM
* Interactor + Service Layer for cleaner networking
* EnvironmentObjects for shared managers

## 💾 Keychain Setup
Breezy uses a SecretsManager to securely load the API key:

```swift 
_ = SecretsManager.shared
```

API key is stored in JSON form:

```swift
struct Credentials: Codable {
    var appid: String
}
```

Stored with:
* `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly`
* Unique service identifier: `com.devstack.Breezy.auth`

## ⚙️ Installation
1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```swift
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Breezy.git
cd Breezy
```

2️⃣ Add Your API Key
Go to:
`SecretsManager.swift` → Replace `appid` with your key (or store it once manually).

3️⃣ Install Dependencies
No external dependencies — native Swift & SwiftUI only.

4️⃣ Run the App
Open `Breezy.xcodeproj` in Xcode → Run on iOS 16+.
